compiling: run "make"

programs:
 - `valhist` for displaying data
 - `slowpipe` for displaying a stream of data with some throttling

Usage example:

    ./slowpipe 1 < log.csv | ./valhist 1 600 400 5 2 650 750

What it does:
Grab one line per millisecond from log.csv. Assume that the file has one data
column. Create a window with a width of 600 and a height of 400 pixels. Shift
the graph after each set of five values (meaning that there are five dots,
possibly in the same location, per column in the graph). Draw the graph
when you've shifted it 2 times. Assume that the values range from 650 to 750.
